## Methodological notes

This research relies on mixed methods, adding another layer of interpretation to the qualitative analysis by embracing quantitative methods.[^readme-1] Therefore, mixed methods could be defined as integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study, exploring the data and research themes from multiple angles.[^readme-2] The application of combined methods allows, consequently, to take a step towards a more comprehensive observation, taking advantage of contributions from both approaches.

According to Biber and colleagues,[^readme-3] research in Corpus Linguistics can traditionally be viewed as a mixed approach since quantitative data in the field of language science depend not only on the analyst's perspective for interpreting the presented categories but also for understanding their implications.

This paper adopts what Creswell and Creswell[^readme-4] and Mackey and Bryfonski[^readme-5] define as a sequential method in which quantitative and qualitative analyses are sequentially alternated. The idea behind this perspective is that these approaches complement each other regarding data scraping, analysis, and interpretation.
